Hi, I'm Yunshu Zhang, a student at the University of Toronto majoring in Math and Statistics. My passion involves deciphering the mysteries around numbers and data, and I am excited to work in an environment where I can use my analytical abilities to solve practical issues. I enjoy seeing unfamiliar places, learning about various cultures, and taking pictures with my camera when I have free time. Please get in touch with me if you'd like to discuss potential collaborations or just talk about anything mathematics, statistics, or travel!
